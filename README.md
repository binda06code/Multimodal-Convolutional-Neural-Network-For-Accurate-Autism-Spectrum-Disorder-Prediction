# Multimodal-Convolutional-Neural-Network-For-Accurate-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Prediction
## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a research project focused on the timely diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based multimodal approach. The project aims to identify specific behaviors from images and eye movements in children aged 6 to 36 months, focusing on various facial expressions (positive, negative, and neutral).

### Dataset

The dataset comprises 2939 images of autistic and non-autistic individuals demonstrating various facial expressions. Additionally, eye-tracking data includes statistical features such as pupil diameter and gaze vectors.

## Approach

The project follows a two-stage approach:

1. **Model Development**: CNN models are developed for the image dataset using architectures like Inception, VGG-19, and MobileNet. For the eye-tracking dataset, LSTM and KNN models are employed.

2. **Web Application**: A web application is created for ASD prediction based on the multimodal approach. Jupyter Notebook is utilized for multimodal training, while HTML, CSS, and Python are employed for web application development.

## Related Work

The repository includes a review of related work in the field of ASD diagnosis, highlighting previous research utilizing CNN algorithms and other techniques for early detection.

## Success Criterion

The main objective of this project is to develop a multi-modal-based web application that can accurately identify ASD using facial images and eye-tracking datasets.

## Purpose and Motivation

The purpose of this project is to address the limitations in current ASD diagnosis methods, which heavily rely on subjective behavioral observations. The motivation stems from the need for a more accurate, comprehensive, and accessible ASD diagnostic approach.

## Aim & Objectives

### Aim:
Build a computer model using facial expressions and eye tracking datasets for early intervention of ASD.

### Objectives:
- Propose a CNN model for ASD identification that can take facial images and eye-tracking data as input.
- Develop a user-friendly web application for accurate ASD detection.

## Scope

The scope of the project includes improving ASD diagnosis accuracy through optimizing deep learning model architectures, expanding diverse datasets, fine-tuning parameters, implementing accurate cross-validation, developing user-friendly web applications, and exploring real-time analysis capabilities.
