I have trained all the models and saved the models with the .h5, for prediction of a specific
model. Just run the 'predictions.ipynb' file and load the .h5 files of each model. If you 
want to make a seperate predictions for each then make multiple copies of 'predictions.ipynb' file.
And load each .h5 model accordingly to each 'predictions.ipynb' file. While, loading a model
either put the 'predictions.ipynb' file in each folder i.e. if you want to run the 'Effientnet'
models, just put the 'predictions.ipynb' file in 'Effientnet' folder and run it by changing the name
for each .h5 files. If the 'predictions.ipynb' file is in the same folder then you 
do not need to give a seperate path to tf.keras.models.load_model('autism-elu.h5', compile = False).
